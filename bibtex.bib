We present a taxonomy of inductive problems that helps to clarify the relationships between familiar inductive problems such as generalization, categorization, and identification, and that introduces new inductive problems for psychological investigation. Our taxonomy is founded on the idea that semantic knowledge is organized into systems of objects, features, categories, and relations, and we attempt to characterize all of the inductive problems that can arise when these systems are partially observed. Recent studies have begun to address some of the new problems in our taxonomy, and future work should aim to develop unified theories of inductive reasoning that explain how people solve all of the problems in the taxonomy")

@String(lucas2015improved="When people want to identify the causes of an event, assign credit or blame, or learn from their mistakes, they often reflect on how things could have gone differently. In this kind of reasoning, one considers a counterfactual world in which some events are different from their real-world counterparts and considers what else would have changed. Researchers have recently proposed several probabilistic models that aim to capture how people do (or should) reason about counterfactuals. We present a new model and show that it accounts better for human inferences than several alternative models. Our model builds on the work of Pearl (2000), and extends his approach in a way that accommodates backtracking inferences and that acknowledges the difference between counterfactual interventions and counterfactual observations. We present 6 new experiments and analyze data from 4 experiments carried out by Rips (2010), and the results suggest that the new model provides an accurate account of both mean human judgments and the judgments of individuals.(PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)")

Temporal reasoning (TR), in particular, presents a significant challenge for LLMs due to its reliance on diverse temporal expressions and intricate contextual details. In this paper, we propose TG-LLM, a new framework towards language-based TR. To be specific, we first teach LLM to translate the context into a temporal graph (TG). A synthetic dataset, which is fully controllable and requires minimal supervision, is constructed for fine-tuning on this graph translation task. We confirm in experiments that the capability of TG extraction learned on our dataset can be transferred to other TR tasks and benchmarks. On top of that, we guide LLM to perform symbolic reasoning over the TG via Chain of Thoughts (CoTs) bootstrapping and special data augmentation strategies. We observe that CoTs with symbolic reasoning bring more consistent and reliable results than those using free-form text.")

This paper introduces LogicLLaMA, a LLaMA-7B model fine-tuned for NL-FOL translation using LoRA on a single GPU. LogicLLaMA is capable of directly translating natural language into FOL rules, which outperforms GPT-3.5. LogicLLaMA is also equipped to correct FOL rules predicted by GPT-3.5, and can achieve similar performance as GPT-4 with a fraction of the cost. This correction ability was achieved by a novel supervised fine-tuning (SFT) + reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) framework, which initially trains on synthetically perturbed NL-FOL pairs to encourage chain-of-thought reasoning and then fine-tunes with RLHF on GPT-3.5 outputs using a FOL verifier as the reward model. To train LogicLLaMA, we present MALLS (large language Model generAted NL-FOL pairS), a dataset of 34K high-quality and diverse sentence-level NL-FOL pairs collected from GPT-4. The dataset was created by implementing a pipeline that prompts GPT-4 for pairs, and dynamically adjusts the prompts to ensure the collection of pairs with rich and diverse contexts at different levels of complexity, and verifies the validity of the generated FOL rules.")

However, due to the complexity that the notion of time introduces to the learning of the rules, an accurate graph reasoning, e.g., predicting new links between entities, is still a difficult problem. In this paper, we propose TILP, a differentiable framework for temporal logical rules learning. By designing a constrained random walk mechanism and the introduction of temporal operators, we ensure the efficiency of our model. We present temporal features modeling in tKG, e.g., recurrence, temporal order, interval between pair of relations, and duration, and incorporate it into our learning process. We compare TILP with state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets. We show that our proposed framework can improve upon the performance of baseline methods while providing interpretable results. In particular, we consider various scenarios in which training samples are limited, data is biased, and the time range between training and inference are different. In all these cases, TILP works much better than the state-of-the-art methods.")

@String(abs-2106-11417="Recently deep reinforcement learning has achieved tremendous success in wide ranges of applications. However, it notoriously lacks data-efficiency and interpretability. Data-efficiency is important as interacting with the environment is expensive. Further, interpretability can increase the transparency of the black-box-style deep RL models and hence gain trust from the users. In this work, we propose a new hierarchical framework via symbolic RL, leveraging a symbolic transition model to improve the data-efficiency and introduce the interpretability for learned policy. This framework consists of a high-level agent, a subtask solver and a symbolic transition model. Without assuming any prior knowledge on the state transition, we adopt inductive logic programming (ILP) to learn the rules of symbolic state transitions, introducing interpretability and making the learned behavior understandable to users. In empirical experiments, we confirmed that the proposed framework offers approximately between 30\% to 40\% more data efficiency over previous methods.")

We examine the effectiveness of the proposed NLN framework in learning Boolean functions and discrete-algorithmic tasks. We demonstrate that, in contrast to the implicit learning in MLP approach, the proposed neural logic networks can learn the logical functions explicitly that can be verified and interpreted by human. In particular, we propose a new framework for learning the inductive logic programming (ILP) problems by exploiting the explicit representational power of NLN. We show the proposed neural ILP solver is capable of feats such as predicate invention and recursion and can outperform the current state of the art neural ILP solvers using a variety of benchmark tasks such as decimal addition and multiplication, and sorting on ordered list.")
